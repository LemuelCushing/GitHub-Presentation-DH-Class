  + _Experiment_ with different versions of a document while maintaining the original version
  + _‘Merge’_ two versions of a document and manage conflicts between versions

# Key Terms
  - Repository
<!--    A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.-->
  - Branch
<!--    Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.-->
  - Master
<!--
    By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
    When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
-->
  - Commit <!--    On GitHub, saved changes are called commits-->
    - Commit Request
<!--       Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.-->
  - Pull
    - Pull Request
<!--      Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.-->
  - Diffs
<!--    Differences - Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.-->
